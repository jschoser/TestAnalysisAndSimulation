"""
Shows map with colour coding for different statistics relating to aircraft emissions and ground pollution due to
aircraft. The available statistics for a selected pair of emission-pollution chemicals are:
    - Emissions of aircraft summed over a specified altitude range
    - Ground pollution due to aircraft summed over 21 days (January or July)
    - Ratio of ground pollution to emissions due to aviation
In order to obtain a single value for the country, several methods of combining the per-grid-cell data are supported:
    - Area average, which sums the data over the entire area of the country and then divides by its surface area
    - Median, which takes the median of all values in the country
The user can select between summer and winter using a boolean and define the altitude ranges over which emissions are
considered (e.g. to separate cruise and LTO emissions). In addition to that, outlier countries can be specified to make
local differences more visible. Countries who cause a division by zero during the calculation (e.g. if the emissions
are zero in the ratio statistic) will automatically be removed. All removed countries are shown in black.

In addition to a map displaying the data per country, the program outputs three indicators of spatial auto correlation:
Geary's C and global and local Moran's I. Global statistics are printed as a single value, while local statistics are
shown in a map
